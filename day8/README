proof s of this program ?

rotating a sequence of size S is same as original

1 2 3
*

move 1 right 3 places , here size = 3
then 1 ends up in original position
- digits that fall off end wrap around to beginning of sequence

circular sequence

model the transition from all off to rectangle A by B top left to on , leaving rest off

50 wide by 6 pixels high
0,0 to 49,5 inclusive grid

show this is true in general ?
for arbitrary size of n elements , a circular rotation n times is equivalent to 0 rotations
left rotation is equivalent to (size - 1) right rotations

n left rotations + n right rotations = same starting location

a left rotations + b right rotations + a2 left rotations + b2 right rotations = same
starting location if sum As = sum Bs
